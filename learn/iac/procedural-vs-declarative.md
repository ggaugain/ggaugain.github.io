# Procedural vs Declarative

DevOps tools come in two categories that define their actions: declarative and procedural.

* Chef and Ansible encourage a procedural style where you write code that specifies, step-by-step, how to to achieve some desired end state.
* Terraform, CloudFormation, SaltStack, and Puppet all encourage a more declarative style where you write code that specifies your desired end state, and the IAC tool itself is responsible for figuring out how to achieve that state.

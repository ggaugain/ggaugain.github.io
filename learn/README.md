# Learning Path

> A Learning Path is a selection of informations for learners to progress through, mastering a particular subject or program.
The essential difference between Technology One Pagers and Learning Path. It must lead you to deep dives on solution addressed.

The Learning Path should roughly follow this structure:
* Introduction / What is the technology
* From Zero to Hero! (This section can be help you to improve your skill)
* Examples (implementation, build & run, ...)
* Further Reading (Blog Posts and Talk)

The learning stages are broken down into 4 parts:
* Stage 1 Concepts is introductory material recommended.
* Stage 2 Foundations will form the building blocks who want to “brush up” on their skills.
* Stage 3 Core covers intermediate material which is about broadening skills, as well as learning Architecture best practices & patterns and beginning to understand the basics.
* Stage 4 Deep Dives is for those who want to specialise.

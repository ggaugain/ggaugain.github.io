## What is K6?
k6 is a developer-centric, free and open-source load testing tool built for making performance testing a productive and enjoyable experience.
> docs: https://k6.io/docs/

K6 is an awesome open-source load testing framework written in Go. It is highly efficient and capable of generating high loads with hundreds of concurrent connections.
It can be used independently as a command-line tool to run load tests, or combined with other tools for different visualisations and analysis.

**Use cases**
* Load Testing
* Performance monitoring

**What is Load/Performance Testing?**

(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing)

There are many types of tests catered for different purposes in performance testing:
* Load testing: basically, putting load on the system to see how it behaves.
* Stress testing: load testing to find the maximum amount of load the system can handle.
* Soak testing: load testing a system continuously and monitoring for memory leaks and behavior of the system.
* Spike testing: load testing with sudden increase or decrease of the load.
* Breakpoint testing: like stress testing, but incremental load is put on the system over time to see how it behaves.
* Configuration testing: changing configuration to see how the system behaves under different configurations, under load.
* Isolation testing: Isolating a fault domain and repeating the test to confirm the failure.
* Internet testing: global load testing for big companies to see how to system behaves from different regions.

**test.k6.io**
Another cool thing about k6 is that they have a test environment for you to run tests against. If you navigate to [test.k6.io](http://test.k6.io) you’ll see other urls they have that you can hit to test different things.

## Alternatives
* [Gatling](https://gatling.io/) - (you write your tests in Scala)
* [Locust.io](https://locust.io/) - (you write your tests in Python)

## Example
An example K6 script to invoke a remote service with Login form + authenticated page to [test.k6.io](http://test.k6.io).
Now seeing all those cool metrics spew out on the terminal is indeed interesting but to really make use of k6 we might want to store that data for future reference.

I’ve based this example heavily on the K6 documentation and examples here:
* https://k6.io/docs/results-visualization/influxdb-+-grafana#using-our-docker-compose-setup


<img src="/techno/data/k6/k6-lab.png" align="center" width="40%" />

* [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) is time-series database
* [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) is browser UI for data visualisation
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform for containers


Navigate to https://localhost:3000 to access the Grafana interface.

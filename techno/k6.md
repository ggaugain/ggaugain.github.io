## What is Performance Load Testing?

There are many types of tests catered for different purposes in performance testing:
* Load testing: basically, putting load on the system to see how it behaves.
* Stress testing: load testing to find the maximum amount of load the system can handle.
* Soak testing: load testing a system continuously and monitoring for memory leaks and behavior of the system.
* Spike testing: load testing with sudden increase or decrease of the load.
* Breakpoint testing: like stress testing, but incremental load is put on the system over time to see how it behaves.
* Configuration testing: changing configuration to see how the system behaves under different configurations, under load.
* Isolation testing: Isolating a fault domain and repeating the test to confirm the failure.
* Internet testing: global load testing for big companies to see how to system behaves from different regions.

## What is K6?
K6 is an awesome open-source load testing framework written in Go. It is highly efficient and capable of generating high loads with hundreds of concurrent connections.
It can be used independently as a command-line tool to run load tests, or combined with other tools for different visualisations and analysis.

**Use cases**
* Load Testing
* Performance monitoring

**Integrating performance testing in CI-CD**

With Load Performance Testing, you can test the impact of any pending code changes to your application’s backend in GitLab CI/CD.

[GitLab uses k6](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/load_performance_testing.html), a free and open source tool, for measuring the system performance of applications under load.

Unlike Browser Performance Testing, which is used to measure how web sites perform in client browsers, Load Performance Testing can be used to perform various types of load tests against application endpoints such as APIs, Web Controllers, and so on. This can be used to test how the backend or the server performs at scale.

For example, you can use Load Performance Testing to perform many concurrent GET calls to a popular API endpoint in your application to see how it performs.

**Running k6**

k6 works with the concept of virtual users (VUs) that execute scripts - they're essentially glorified, parallel while(true) loops. Scripts are written using JavaScript, as ES6 modules, which allows you to break larger tests into smaller and more reusable pieces, making it easy to scale tests across an organization.

**Outputs**

To make full use of your test results and to be able to fully explore and understand them, k6 can output the raw metrics to an external repository of your choice.

**Modules and JavaScript compatibility**

k6 comes with several built-in modules for things like making (and measuring) HTTP requests and websocket connections, parsing HTML, reading files, calculating hashes, setting up checks and thresholds, tracking custom metrics, and others.

**test.k6.io**

Another cool thing about k6 is that they have a test environment for you to run tests against. If you navigate to [test.k6.io](http://test.k6.io) you’ll see other urls they have that you can hit to test different things.

**Support**

How do I? -- the Discourse forum at community.k6.io or Stack Overflow (use tags: k6, javascript, load-testing)

## Alternatives
* [Gatling](https://gatling.io/) - (you write your tests in Scala)
* [Locust.io](https://locust.io/) - (you write your tests in Python)

## Example
An example K6 script to invoke a remote service to [test.k6.io](http://test.k6.io).

I’ve based this example heavily on the K6 documentation and examples here:
* https://k6.io/docs/results-visualization/influxdb-+-grafana#using-our-docker-compose-setup

Now seeing all those cool metrics spew out on the terminal is indeed interesting but to really make use of k6 we might want to store that data for future reference.

* [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) is time-series database
* [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) is browser UI for data visualisation
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform for containers

**Usage**

```
# Requirements
$ docker
$ docker-compose
$ git

# Clone the source repo
git clone 'https://github.com/ggaugain/docker-k6-grafana-influxdb.git'
cd docker-k6-grafana-influxdb

# Update git submodules
git submodule update --init

# Deploy influxdb and grafana containers in the background
docker-compose up -d influxdb grafana

# Run the k6 container separately so that you don't have to restart influx and grafana every time you want to run your tests
docker-compose run -v $PWD/samples:/scripts k6 run /scripts/k6test.js
```

Navigate to https://localhost:3000 to access the Grafana interface.
